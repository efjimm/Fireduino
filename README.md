# IOT Project

## Premise

The idea is to store a schedule / timetable, which will light up LEDs based on the current time in
relations to the timetable. It may also do other things such as beeping a speaker depending on the
current item.

## Considerations

Further research has to be done to determine the method for keeping track of time -
maybe getting the time from an NTP server once a day would work.

## Challenges

Currently unsure how to interface
with this in regards to changing the timetable from a cloud control panel.
